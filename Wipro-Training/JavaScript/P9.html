    <p>JSON - JavaScript Object Notation 
        Its a lightweight data interchange format
        Storing data in the form of object
        LANGUAGE INDEPENDENT(Every language now supports json)
        -client sends data to server and server sends some data to clients :client uses java(array) to send data but server uses python(list) to send the data ,so both are different languages how will data exchange occur between them (array and python)?
        -So for the solution we use json as a intermediate language to communicate between 2 languages
        -json converts java to json then converts it to python for server understandable language.
